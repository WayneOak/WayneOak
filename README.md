- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Wayne
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning programming and coding
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve recently completed augiting the Harvard CS50 course online. That was a very good program and I would have loved to attended in person. Now on to more Python learning.
- Books I'm reading or have recently finished.
  - Pragmatic Thinking & Learning. Refactor your wetware by Andy Hunt. (http://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl)
  -   The rich-mode, linear-mode explanations really hit home for me. I have the most difficulty switching into rich-mode, linear-mode is definitely my default.
  - Next book is the Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt as well.
  - I have also started The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene. I wish I could have read this, and wanted to read this, when I was much younger.
- I am using Obsidian for note taking. It is quite the tool and I am enjoying discovering how to use it.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am retired from over 25 years in Information Systems support specialing in deploying and managing Enterprise VMware environments. I am exploring programming as a way to keep my mind exercised and am more than willing to collaborate with anyone on any project. I am a novice programmer, with years of scripting experience, so keep that in mind.
