- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Wayne
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning programming and coding
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking the Harvard CS50 course online and am on week 3
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am retired from over 25 years in Information Systems support specialing in deploying and managing Enterprise VMware environments. I am exploring programming as a way to keep my mind exercised and am more than willing to collaborate with anyone on any project. I am a novice programmer, with years of scripting experience, so keep that in mind.
