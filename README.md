- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Wayne
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning programming and coding
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking the Harvard CS50 course online and am on week 7, SQL. Week 4 was interesting, I didn't realise how easy it is to manipulate image files, or any file for that matter.
- Books I'm reading or have recently finished.
  - Pragmatic Thinking & Learning. Refactor your wetware by Andy Hunt. (http://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl)
    - The rich-mode, linear-mode explanations really hit home for me. I have the most difficulty switching into rich-mode, linear-mode is definitely my default.
  - Next book is the Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt as well.
- I installed Obsidian the other day and am having fun configuring it. It is one versatile program. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am retired from over 25 years in Information Systems support specialing in deploying and managing Enterprise VMware environments. I am exploring programming as a way to keep my mind exercised and am more than willing to collaborate with anyone on any project. I am a novice programmer, with years of scripting experience, so keep that in mind.
